**Numerical Analysis MATH50003 (2023–24) Problem Sheet 2**



**Problem 1** 
Show that dual numbers $𝔻$ are a _commutative ring_, that is, for all $a,b,c ∈ 𝔻$ the following are satisfied:
1. _additive associativity_: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
2. _additive commutativity_: $a + b = b + a$
3. _additive identity_: There exists $0 ∈ 𝔻$ such that $a + 0 = a$.
4. _additive inverse_: There exists $-a$ such that $(-a) + a = 0$.
5. _multiplicative associativity_: $(ab)c = a(bc)$
6. _multiplictive commutativity_: $ab = ba$
7. _multiplictive identity_: There exists $1 ∈ 𝔻$ such that $1a= a$.
8. _distributive_: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$






**Problem 2** What should the following functions applied to dual numbers return for $x = a+b ϵ$:
$$
f(x) = x^{10}    + 1, g(x) = 1/x, h(x) = \tan x
$$
State  the domain where these definitions are valid.


**Problem 3(a)** What is the correct definition of division on dual numbers, i.e.,
$$
(a + b ϵ )/(c + d ϵ ) = s + t ϵ
$$
for what choice of $s$ and $t$? 



**Problem 3(b)** A _field_ is a commutative ring such that $0 ≠ 1$ and all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse, i.e.,
there exists $a^{-1}$ such that $a a^{-1} = 1$. Can we use Problem 4(b) to define $a^{-1} := 1/a$ to make $𝔻$ a field? Why or why not?


 


**Problem 4** Use dual numbers to compute the derivative of the following functions at $x = 0.1$:
$$
\exp(\exp x \cos x + \sin x), \prod_{k=1}^3 \left({x \over k}-1\right),\hbox{ and } f^{\rm s}_2(x) = {1 + {x - 1 \over 2 + {x-1 \over 2}}}
$$
