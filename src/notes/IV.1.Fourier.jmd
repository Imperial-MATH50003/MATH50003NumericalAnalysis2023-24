## Review of Fourier series


The most fundamental basis is (complex) Fourier: we have ${\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}$
are orthogonal with respect to the inner product
$$
⟨f, g ⟩ := {1 \over 2π} ∫_0^{2π} \bar f(θ) g(θ) {\rm d}θ,
$$
where we conjugate the first argument to be consistent with the vector inner product $𝐱^⋆ 𝐲$.
We will use the notation $𝕋 := [0,2π)$ (typically this has the topology of a circle attached but
we do not need to worry about that here).
We can (typically) expand functions in this basis:

**Definition (Fourier)** A function $f$ has a Fourier expansion if
$$
f(θ) = ∑_{k = -∞}^∞ \hat f_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}
$$
where
$$
\hat f_k := ⟨{\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}, f⟩ = {1 \over 2π} ∫_0^{2π}  {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ} f(θ) {\rm d}θ
$$
∎

A basic observation is if a Fourier expansion has no negative terms it is equivalent to a Taylor series
if we write $z = {\rm e}^{{\rm i} θ}$:

**Definition (Fourier-Taylor)** A function $f$ has a Fourier–Taylor expansion if
$$
f(θ) = ∑_{k = 0}^∞ \hat f_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}
$$
where $\hat f_k := ⟨{\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}, f⟩$.
∎


In numerical analysis we try to build on the analogy with linear algebra as much as possible.
Therefore we  can write this this as:
$$
f(θ) = \underbrace{[1 | {\rm e}^{{\rm i}θ} | {\rm e}^{2{\rm i}θ} | ⋯]}_{T(θ)}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} \hat f_0 \\ \hat f_1 \\ \hat f_2 \\ ⋮ \end{bmatrix}}_{\vchatf}.
$$
Essentially, expansions in bases are viewed as a way of turning _functions_ into (infinite) _vectors_.
And (differential) _operators_ into _matrices_.




In analysis one typically works with continuous functions and relates results to continuity.
In numerical analysis we inheritely have to work with _vectors_, so it is more natural
to  focus on the case where the _Fourier coefficients_ $\hat f_k$ are _absolutely convergent_:


**Definition (absolute convergent)** We write
$\vchatf ∈ ℓ^1$ if it is absolutely convergent,
or in otherwords, the $1$-norm of $\vchatf$ is bounded:
$$
\|\vchatf\|_1 := ∑_{k=-∞}^∞ |\hat f_k| < ∞
$$
∎

We first state a  basic results (whose proof is beyond the scope of this module):

**Theorem (2-norm convergence)**
If $f, g : 𝕋 → ℂ$ are continuous and $\hat f_k = \hat g_k$ for all $k ∈ ℤ$ then $f = g$.

**Proof**
See [Körner 2022 (Theorem 2.4)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fourier-analysis/5FD8F0FD69DDB139019655D7F8440D2F).
∎

This allows us to proof the following:

**Theorem (Absolute convergence)**
If $\vchatf ∈ ℓ^1$ then
$$
f(θ) = ∑_{k = -∞}^∞ \hat f_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ},
$$
which converges uniformly.
**Proof**

Note that
$$
g_n(θ) := ∑_{k = -n}^n \hat f_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}
$$
is absolutely convergent as $n → ∞$, hence converges uniformly to a continuous function $g$. We have for $n > k$
$$
\hat f_k =
$$


∎


Continuity gives us sufficient (though not necessary) conditions for absolute convergence:

**Lemma (differentiability and absolutely convergence)** If $f : ℝ → ℂ$ and $f'$ are periodic
 and $f''$ is uniformly bounded, then $\vchatf ∈ ℓ^1$.

**Proof**
Integrate by parts twice using the fact that $f(0) = f(2π)$, $f'(0) = f'(2π)$:
$$
\begin{align*}
2π\hat f_k &= ∫_0^{2π} f(θ) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ} {\rm d}θ =
[f(θ) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ}]_0^{2π} + {1 \over {\rm i} k} ∫_0^{2π} f'(θ) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ} {\rm d}θ \\
&= {1 \over {\rm i} k} [f'(θ) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ}]_0^{2π} - {1 \over k^2} ∫_0^{2π} f''(θ) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ} {\rm d}θ \\
&= - {1 \over k^2} ∫_0^{2π} f''(θ) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ} {\rm d}θ
\end{align*}
$$
thus uniform boundedness of $f''$ guarantees $|\hat f_k| ≤ M |k|^{-2}$ for some $M$, and we have
$$
∑_{k = -∞}^∞ |\hat f_k| ≤ |\hat f_0|  + 2M ∑_{k = 1}^∞ |k|^{-2}  < ∞
$$
using the dominant convergence test.

∎

This condition can be weakened to Lipschitz continuity but the proof is  beyond the scope
of this module.
Of more practical importance is the other direction: the more times differentiable a function the
faster the coefficients decay, and thence the faster Fourier expansions converge.
In fact, if a function is smooth and 2π-periodic its Fourier coefficients decay
faster than algebraically: they decay like $O(k^{-λ})$ for any $λ$. This will be explored in the
problem sheet.

**Remark** Going further, if we let $z = {\rm e}^{{\rm i} θ}$ then if $f(z)$ is _analytic_ in a
neighbourhood of the unit circle the Fourier coefficients decay _exponentially fast_. And if $f(z)$ is entire
they decay even faster than exponentially.


## Trapezium rule and discrete Fourier coefficients



**Definition (Trapezium Rule)** Let $θ_j = 2πj/n$ for $j = 0,1,…,n$ denote $n+1$ evenly spaced points over $[0,2π]$.
The _Trapezium rule_ over $[0,2π]$ is the approximation:
$$
∫_0^{2π} f(θ) {\rm d}θ ≈ {2 π \over n} \left[{f(0) \over 2} + ∑_{j=1}^{n-1} f(θ_j) + {f(2 π) \over 2} \right]
$$
But if $f$ is periodic we have $f(0) = f(2π)$ we get the _periodic Trapezium rule_:
$$
∫_0^{2π} f(θ) {\rm d}θ ≈ 2 π\underbrace{{1 \over n} ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} f(θ_j)}_{Σ_n[f]}
$$
∎



We know that ${\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}$ are orthogonal with respect to the continuous inner product.
The following says that this property is maintained (up to “aliasing") when we replace the continuous
integral with a trapezium rule approximation:

**Lemma (Discrete orthogonality)**
We have:
$$
∑_{j=0}^{n-1} {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ_j} =
\begin{cases} n & k = \ldots,-2n,-n,0,n,2n,\ldots  \cr
              0 & \hbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
In other words,
$$
Σ_n[{\rm e}^{{\rm i} (k-ℓ) θ}] =
\begin{cases} 1 & k-ℓ = \ldots,-2n,-n,0,n,2n,\ldots  \cr
              0 & \hbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}.
$$

**Proof**

Consider $ω := {\rm e}^{{\rm i} θ_1} = {\rm e}^{2 π {\rm i} \over n}$. This is an $n$ th root of unity: $ω^n = 1$.
Note that ${\rm e}^{{\rm i} θ_j} ={\rm e}^{2 π {\rm i} j \over n}= ω^j$.

(Case 1: $k = pn$ for an integer $p$)
We have
$$
∑_{j=0}^{n-1} {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ_j} = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} ω^{kj} = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} ({ω^{pn}})^j =   ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} 1 = n
$$
(Case 2 $k ≠ pn$ for an integer $p$)  Recall that
$$
∑_{j=0}^{n-1} z^j = {z^n-1 \over z-1}.
$$
Then we have
$$
∑_{j=0}^{n-1} {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ_j} = ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} (ω^k)^j = {ω^{kn} -1 \over ω^k -1} = 0.
$$
where we use the fact that $k$ is not a multiple of $n$ to guarantee that $ω^k ≠ 1$.

∎

## Convergence of Approximate Fourier expansions

We will now use the Trapezium rule to approximate Fourier coefficients and expansions:

**Definition (Discrete Fourier coefficients)** Define the Trapezium rule approximation to the Fourier coefficients by:
$$
\hat f_k^n := Σ_n[{\rm e}^{-i k θ} f(θ)]  = {1 \over n} ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} {\rm e}^{-i k θ_j} f(θ_j)
$$
∎

A remarkable fact is that the discete Fourier coefficients can be expressed as a sum of
the true Fourier coefficients:

**Theorem (discrete Fourier coefficients)**
If $\vchatf ∈ ℓ^1$ (absolutely convergent Fourier coefficients) then
$$
\hat f_k^n = ⋯ + \hat f_{k-2n} + \hat f_{k-n} + \hat f_k + \hat f_{k+n} + \hat f_{k+2n} + ⋯
$$

**Proof**
$$
\begin{align*}
\hat f_k^n &= Σ_n[f(θ) {\rm e}^{-{\rm i} k θ}] = ∑_{ℓ=-∞}^∞ \hat f_ℓ Σ_n[{\rm e}^{{\rm i} (ℓ-k) θ}] \\
&= ∑_{ℓ=-∞}^∞ \hat f_ℓ \begin{cases} 1 & ℓ-k = \ldots,-2n,-n,0,n,2n,\ldots  \cr
0 & \hbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
∎

Note that there is redundancy:

**Corollary (aliasing)**
For all $p ∈ ℤ$, $\hat f_k^n = \hat f_{k+pn}^n$.

**Proof**

∎


In other words if we know $\hat f_0^n, …, \hat f_{n-1}^n$, we know $\hat f_k^n$ for all $k$ via a permutation,
for example if $n = 2m+1$ we have
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat f_{-m}^n \\
⋮\\
\hat f_m^n
\end{bmatrix} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} &&& 1 \\ &&&& ⋱ \\ &&&&& 1 \\
    1 \\ & ⋱ \\ && 1 \end{bmatrix}}_{P_σ}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat f_0^n \\
⋮\\
\hat f_{n-1}^n
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $σ$ has Cauchy notation (_Careful_: we are using 1-based indexing here):
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & ⋯ & m & m+1 & m+2 & ⋯ & n  \\
m+2 & m+3 & ⋯ & n & 1 & 2 & ⋯ & m+1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$



We first discuss the case when all negative coefficients are zero.
That is, $\hat f_0^n, …, \hat f_{n-1}^n$ are approximations of the Fourier–Taylor coefficients by evaluating
on the boundary.



We can  prove _convergence_ whenever of this
approximation whenever $f$ has absolutely summable coefficients.
We will prove the result here in the special case where the negative
coefficients are zero.


**Theorem (Approximate Fourier-Taylor expansions converge)**
If $0 = \hat f_{-1} = \hat f_{-2} = ⋯$ and $\vchatf$ is absolutely convergent then
$$
f_n(θ) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} \hat f_k^n {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}
$$
converges uniformly to $f(θ)$.

**Proof**

$$
\begin{align*}
|f(θ) - f_n(θ)| = |∑_{k=0}^{n-1} (\hat f_k - \hat f_k^n) {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ} + ∑_{k=n}^∞ \hat f_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}|
= |∑_{k=n}^∞ \hat f_k ({\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ} - {\rm e}^{{\rm i} {\rm mod}(k,n) θ})|
≤ 2 ∑_{k=n}^∞ |\hat f_k|
\end{align*}
$$
which goes to zero as $n → ∞$.
∎

For the general case we need to choose a range of coefficients that includes roughly an equal number of
negative and positive coefficients (preferring negative over positive in a tie as a convention):
$$
f_n(θ) = ∑_{k=-⌈n/2⌉}^{⌊n/2⌋} \hat f_k {\rm e}^{{\rm i} k θ}
$$
In the problem sheet we will prove this converges provided the coefficients are absolutely convergent.
