**Numerical Analysis MATH50003 (2023‚Äì24) Problem Sheet 2**



**Problem 1** 
Show that dual numbers $ùîª$ are a _commutative ring_, that is, for all $a,b,c ‚àà ùîª$ the following are satisfied:
1. _additive associativity_: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
2. _additive commutativity_: $a + b = b + a$
3. _additive identity_: There exists $0 ‚àà ùîª$ such that $a + 0 = a$.
4. _additive inverse_: There exists $-a$ such that $(-a) + a = 0$.
5. _multiplicative associativity_: $(ab)c = a(bc)$
6. _multiplictive commutativity_: $ab = ba$
7. _multiplictive identity_: There exists $1 ‚àà ùîª$ such that $1a= a$.
8. _distributive_: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$

**SOLUTION**
In what follows we write $a = a_r + a_d œµ$ and likewise for $b,c ‚àà ùîª$.

Additive associativity and commutativity and existence of additive inverse are both 
immediate results of dual number addition reducing to element-wise real number addition. 
Furthermore, by definition of addition on $ùîª$ the dual number $0+0 œµ$ acts as the additive 
identity since
$$
(a_r+a_dœµ)+(0+0œµ) = (a_r+a_dœµ ).
$$
We explicitly prove multiplicative commutativity
$$
ab = (a_r+a_dœµ )(b_r+b_d œµ ) = a_r b_r+(a_r b_d+a_d b_r)œµ = b_r a_r+(b_r a_d+b_d a_r)œµ = ba.
$$
We also explicitly prove multiplicative associativity:
$$
(ab)c = ((a_r b_r+(a_r b_d+a_d b_r) œµ ) c = 
a_r b_r c_r + ((a_r b_d + a_d b_r) c_r  + a_r b_r c_d) œµ = 
a_r b_r c_r + (a_r b_d c_r + a_d b_r c_r  + a_r b_r c_d) œµ
$$
and
$$
a(bc) = a ((b_r c_r+(b_r c_d+b_d c_r) œµ ) = a_r b_r c_r + (a_r b_d c_r + a_d b_r c_r  + a_r b_r c_d) œµ.
$$
The number $1+0œµ$ serves as the multiplicative identity. Note that for any dual number $a$, we have
$$
(1+0œµ )(a_r + a_d œµ ) = 1 a_r + (a_r 0 + 1 a_d) œµ = a_r+a_d œµ = a.
$$
Finally we show distributivity of multiplication:
$$
a(b+c) = a (b_r+c_r + (b_d+c_d)œµ) = (a_r b_r + a_r c_r) + (a_r b_d+a_r c_d+ a_d b_r + a_d c_r) œµ,
$$
$$
ab + ac = a_r b_r + (a_d b_r + a_r b_d) œµ + a_r c_r + (a_d c_r + a_r c_d) œµ = (a_r b_r + a_r c_r) + (a_r b_d+a_r c_d+ a_d b_r + a_d c_r) œµ.
$$

**END**




**Problem 2** What should the following functions applied to dual numbers return for $x = a+b œµ$:
$$
f(x) = x^{10}    + 1, g(x) = 1/x, h(x) = \tan x
$$
State  the domain where these definitions are valid.


**Problem 3(a)** What is the correct definition of division on dual numbers, i.e.,
$$
(a + b œµ )/(c + d œµ ) = s + t œµ
$$
for what choice of $s$ and $t$? 

**SOLUTION**

As with complex numbers, division is easiest to understand by first multiplying with the conjugate, that is:
$$
\frac{a+bœµ}{c+dœµ} = \frac{(a+bœµ)(c-dœµ)}{(c+dœµ)(c-dœµ)}.
$$
Expanding the products and dropping terms with $œµ^2$ then leaves us with the definition of division for dual numbers (where the denominator must have non-zero real part):
$$
\frac{a}{c} + \frac{bc - ad}{c^2}œµ.
$$
Thus we have $s = \frac{a}{c}$ and $t = \frac{bc - ad}{c^2}$.




**END**

**Problem 3(b)** A _field_ is a commutative ring such that $0 ‚â† 1$ and all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse, i.e.,
there exists $a^{-1}$ such that $a a^{-1} = 1$. Can we use Problem 4(b) to define $a^{-1} := 1/a$ to make $ùîª$ a field? Why or why not?

**SOLUTION**

Fields require that all nonzero elements have a unique multiplicative inverse. However, this is not the case for dual numbers. To give an explicit counter example, we show that there is no dual number $z$ which is the inverse of $0+œµ$, i.e. a dual number $z$ such that
$$
\frac{(0+œµ)}{(z_r+z_d œµ)} = 1 + 0 œµ.
$$
By appropriate multiplication with the conjugate we show that
$$
\frac{(0+œµ)(z_r-z_d œµ)}{(z_r+z_d œµ)(z_r-z_d œµ)} = \frac{z_r œµ}{z_r^2} = \frac{œµ}{z_r}.
$$
This proves that no choice of real part $z_r$ can reach the multiplicative identity $1+0 œµ$ when starting from the number $0+œµ$. More general results for zero real part dual numbers can also be proved.

**END**
 


**Problem 4** Use dual numbers to compute the derivative of the following functions at $x = 0.1$:
$$
\exp(\exp x \cos x + \sin x), \prod_{k=1}^3 \left({x \over k}-1\right),\hbox{ and } f^{\rm s}_2(x) = {1 + {x - 1 \over 2 + {x-1 \over 2}}}
$$

**SOLUTION**


We now compute the derivatives of the three functions by evaluating for $x = 0.1 + œµ$. For the first function we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
\exp(\exp(0.1 + œµ)\cos(0.1+œµ) + \sin(0.1+œµ)) &=
\exp((\exp(0.1) + œµ\exp(0.1))(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1)œµ) + \sin(0.1)+\cos(0.1)œµ) \\
&= \exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1) + (\exp(0.1)(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1))+\cos(0.1))œµ) \\
&= \exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1)) + \exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1))\exp(0.1)(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1))+\cos(0.1))œµ 
\end{align*}
$$
therefore the derivative is the dual part
$$
\exp(\exp(0.1)\cos(0.1)+ \sin(0.1))(\exp(0.1)(\cos(0.1)-\sin(0.1))+\cos(0.1))
$$

For the second function we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
 \left(0.1+œµ-1\right) \left({0.1 + œµ \over 2}-1\right)\left({0.1 + œµ \over 3}-1\right)
 &=\left(-0.9+œµ\right) \left(-0.95 + œµ/2\right)\left(-29/30 + œµ/3\right) \\
&=\left(171/200 -1.4œµ\right)\left(-29/30 + œµ/3\right)  \\
&= -1653/2000 + 983œµ/600
\end{align*}
$$
Thus the derivative is $983/600$.

For the third function we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
{1 + {0.1+œµ - 1 \over 2 + {0.1+œµ-1 \over 2}}} &=  {1 + {-0.9+œµ \over 1.55 + œµ/2}}\\
&= 1 -18/31 + 2œµ/1.55^2
\end{align*}
$$
Thus the derivative is $2/1.55^2$.
